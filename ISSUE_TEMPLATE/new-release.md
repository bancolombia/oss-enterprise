Title: Release *****/REPO

I'm going to share [REPO name](REPO link) with the world, but before I do, I want to make sure:

## Coordination

- [ ] The repo is visible to the teams below
- [ ] Discuss licensing or other legal concerns with `legal team @mention`
- [ ] Evaluate security concerns with `security team @mention`
- [ ] Request a snazzy logo  from `creative team  @mention`
- [ ] Discuss promotion strategy with `public relations team @mention` and `marketing @mention`

## Preparation

- [ ] It has a name that is easy to remember, gives some idea what the project does, and does [not conflict with an existing project](http://ivantomic.com/projects/ospnc/) or infringe on any [trademarks](http://www.uspto.gov).
- [ ] The repository description includes a link to the project homepage
- [ ] It uses consistent code conventions, clear function/method/variable names, and a sensible public API.
- [ ] The code is clearly commented, documenting intentions and edge cases.
- [ ] The distribution mechanism is as convenient, standard, and low-overhead as possible (RubyGems, Homebrew, Bower, Maven, NuGet, etc.).
- [ ] There are no sensitive materials in the revision history, issues, or pull requests.
- [ ] It uses publicly-accessible continuous integration that integrates with the GitHub status API.
- [ ] `correct email` is provided as a maintainer contact (e.g., in the `.gemspec` `email` field for Ruby gems)
- [ ] It includes the correct `LICENSE` according to [license policy](docs/license-policy.md)
- [ ] It includes an approved [Code of Conduct](templates/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
- [ ] It has a `CONTRIBUTING.md` based on [the template in this repository](templates/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [ ] A project homepage has been created that includes
  - [ ] A reference implementation
  - [ ] End user documentation

## `README.md`

- [ ] It starts with a one-line description that explains what the project is about, who might be interested in it, what language its written in, and how it might be different from similar projects.
- [ ] It includes a list of features and limitations.
- [ ] It states the goals and scope of the project to help set expectations and filter proposed changes down the line.
- [ ] It includes the current status (e.g., proof of concept, used in production, active development, orphaned, etc.)
- [ ] It includes a description of the kind of environment required to run the software and instructions for setting it up.
- [ ] It clearly states the external dependencies and directions for installing them.
- [ ] It includes a high-level development roadmap or link to open issues/milestones.
- [ ] It explicitly asks for contributions with a link to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- [ ] It has a License section that states the license.

## Preparing to Maintain

- [ ] At least one internal employee is committed to managing community interactions by triaging and responding to issues, giving feedback and merging pull requests
- [ ] The process for releasing a new version is clearly documented
- [ ] At least two internal employees have access to release new versions
- [ ] At least one internal employee is committed to pulling each release into other internal products that depend on this project

## :shipit:

- [ ] Make the repository public!
- [ ] Communicate the release internally
- [ ] Launch external marketing efforts
