Title: Release *****/REPO

I'm going to share [REPO name](REPO link) with the world, but before I do, I want to make sure:

## Coordination

- [ ] The repo is visible to the teams below

- [ ] Discuss promotion strategy with `communications team @mention` and `marketing @mention`

## Preparation

- [ ] It uses consistent code conventions and clear function/method/variable names
- [ ] The code is clearly commented, documenting intentions and edge cases.
- [ ] The distribution mechanism is as convenient, standard, and low-overhead as possible (Homebrew, Bower, Maven, NuGet, etc.).
- [ ] There are no sensitive materials in the revision history, issues, or pull requests.
- [ ] Code coverage is greater than 80%
- [ ] It uses publicly-accessible continuous integration that integrates with the GitHub status API.

- [ ] It has a `CONTRIBUTING.md` based on [the template in this repository](https://github.com/bancolombia/oss-enterprise/blob/master/templates/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [ ] A project homepage has been created that includes (when it applies)
  - [ ] A reference implementation
  - [ ] End user documentation

## `README.md`

## Preparing to Maintain

- [ ] At least one internal employee is committed to managing community interactions by triaging and responding to issues, giving feedback and merging pull requests
