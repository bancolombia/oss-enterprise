## Should you make your project available to the public as OSS?

- Would you use this product yourself if someone else made it available as OpenSource?
- Do you think other people would find this valuable?
-  Are you prepared to maintain it and support a growing community? See the [Maintainer Guide](maintainer-guide.md) for more information.
- Are there any outstanding legal issues with trademarks or copyright?
- Is the current project up to date and free (or almost) of bugs?
- Is the project too tied to some internal proprietary information, which can't be released?
- How will you support outside contributors? (Should they sign Contributors License Agreement or DCO?)
- How will you manage the roadmap going forward? What if contributors want to take the project in a direction you may not want to go?
- Once you open source something, do you want to commit to coding in open on project or continue to code internally and share with OSS?
- Can you share issues and pull requests explaining the reason why you wrote the code?
- Are you ready to lose the flexibility to experiment internally without having to take risks in public?
