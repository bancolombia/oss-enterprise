# Maintainer's Guide

As a maintainer of an open source project, you become the face of the company to a community of users and potential contributors. Your actions as a maintainer reflect on our organization as a whole. Before you begin this journey, consider what it means to be a maintainer:

## The role of the Maintainer

A great maintainer:

- Takes responsibility for the health of projects they release.
   - Takes in what they have built, maintains quality to a level befitting of our organization
   - Responds to issues and pull requests in a timely manner.
   - If they can no longer maintain the project, they ensure someone else will.
- Helps users understand how to use their project through documentation and reference implementations
- Helps contributors understand the work to be done and the type of contributions you will accept
- Helps new contributors find meaningful, helpful contributions
- Responds to and supports users reporting bugs or making contributions
   - Identifies who will address bugs
   - Updates the project to the latest versions of dependencies like Ruby or Java?
- Speaks with respect and consideration
   - A good maintainer treats users and contributors fairly, kindly, and with respect.
   - They show appreciation for contributions and are compassionate when offering feedback.
- Enforces the code of conduct to provide a safe, supportive community

## Preparing your project for open source

Check out the [key questions](key-questions-for-choosing-projects.md) and open a [new issue](/issues/new?template=new-release.md) in this repository to signal you are planning to  open source the project. Carefully consider what is in your repository. It was once private and may contain confidential or sensitive discussions.

## Maintaining your project

Create clear documentation for your project to explain the following to your future users and contributors:

- How are contributions reviewed and accepted (Do they need tests? An issue template?)
- What types of contributions will you accept (Do you only want help with a certain part of your code?)
- When it’s appropriate to follow up (ex. “You can expect a response from a maintainer within 7 days. If you haven’t heard anything by then, feel free to ping the thread.”)
- How much time will you spend on the project (ex. “We only spend about 5 hours per week on this project”)

### Encouraging Contributions

An Open Source project is stronger when it has an active and passionate community. However, it can be challenging for new contributors to get started. Here are a few tips to help you build a stronger community:

- Add labels such as `good-first-PR` or `help-wanted` to Issues and Pull Requests to encourage contributions
- Hold virtual office hours for your project to allow the community to connect and discuss challenging problems
- Create great documentation that helps users understand how to use your project, this will make community support a useful task for new contributors  
- Add a roadmap to your project so others can see where it is heading
- Celebrate contributions by listing contributors in your repository or on the project website
